# Putting it all together - Adam Hooper 

## *Hatshepsut* - Build a Tribute Page

## Why you chose the subject?

 Hatshepsut was chosen at random using https://www.seventhsanctum.com/generate.php?Genname=historyscrambler  
 to give me a list of 'random' historical figures so instead of spending time deciding who or what to pick  
 I could start straight away without any bias, Hatshepsut was a figure I knew nothing about so I went with Her. 

## What did you learn making it? 

 I learnt that while I feel comfortable looking at code and interacting with it, not all of the 'syntax' im supposed
 to use immediately came to me ***(especially CSS)*** when I tried to build something from scratch. I discovered how 
 many well crafted resources are out there to quickly get back on track when, for example I needed reminding that 
 a # is used to to style 'id' tags  [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_id.asp) was where I immediately found the solution to my problem.
 This proved much faster than trying to go back through the interactive lessons I had already completed to try
 and find the solution. 
 
## Reflections on the development journey? 

While what I produced was very simple compared to almost every other webpage out there today. Considering the 
only coding experience ive had prior to me starting through the welcome pack earlier this week was the application process, 
it was very rewarding to actually build something starting from a set of blank editors and ending up with a webpage and it
making sense as to why everything works the way it does. Immediately knowing the go to 'syntax' to use will come with time 
and further fimiliarity working with code, im looking forward to having all this and more drilled into me starting from the 15th.
